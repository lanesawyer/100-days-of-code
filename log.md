# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built some React components for my "52 Things" website I started yesterday..

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to really like React. I'm not doing everything "right" at the moment, but getting things to show up and change with Firebase integration is pretty sweet.

**Link to work:** Pending
