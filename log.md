# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built some React components for my "52 Things" website I started yesterday.

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to really like React. I'm not doing everything "right" at the moment, but getting things to show up and change with Firebase integration is pretty sweet.

### Day 2: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some stuff with authentication and styling. The code is ugly, but it's showing a single list for a specific user!

**Thoughts:** Again, my code is a mess, but I'm really enjoying React. In the next few days I'll do some refactoring and get it into a more presentable form.

### Day 3-5: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've done a lot without updating the log. Refactored and added some services to make reading from Firebase easier.

**Thoughts:** I'm having a lot of fun working on this! It's a good little app to help me learn about React and Node.js.

### Day 6: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I made an authorization service to encapsulate getting a user (since it was living in my ThingService). Also added some checks to my forms to not submit when empty. Finally, I made it so that all the categories work, plus you can add new ones!

**Thoughts:** I'm getting a better grip on ES6 and how all that works. My services are looking pretty good. Next step is to pretty it up, add some drag and drop capabilities, and refactor my Firebase React components to be classes instead of CreateElement.

### Day 7: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some styling and made it so you scroll sideways if you have enough categories to warrent it. Started looking into drag and drop a littl too.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I might write a bunch of unit tests. I haven't tried testing it at all yet. It's coming along though! I need to play with the CSS to get the scrolling and heights and everything to work correctly.

### Day 8-9: January 8-9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not sure what I did yesterday, but today was starting on trying to get the counter to work.

**Thoughts:** Not much.

### Day 10-11: January 10-11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I always forget to update this every day. Yesterday was adding in Font Awesome, got the counter working, and added "order" to new categories when they're created. Today I added a service worker!

**Thoughts:** I got stuck on adding the service worker simply because the service worker has a different lifecycle. I had to do a hard refresh on the page to get it working and I just never tried it. Finally got it working though, even though I feel like an idiot haha

### Day 12: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made the site a little bit prettier (although it still has miles to go) and got the display name on the user sign up screen.

**Thoughts:** I'm not really sure how I'm going to use Firebase with the service worker yet. That'll be fun to figure out! Firebase is about always-on connectivity, so getting in the middle of that to do caching will be interesting.

### Day 13: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I missed yesterday due to a long day of work, but I'm back at it today! I added a counting service and changed the look and feel a little bit.

**Thoughts:** It's starting to take shape! I still have a few pieces of logic I have to implement to keep all the counts and everything in sync, but that won't be hard.

### Day 14: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Missed a lot of days due to traveling for work last week. Today I added a little more logic to get closer to having tasks get deleting when its category is removed. I should check if Firebase can do this stuff automatically.

**Thoughts:** It's good to get back to coding in the evenings. I'm enjoying creating this little app!
