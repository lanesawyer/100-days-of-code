# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built some React components for my "52 Things" website I started yesterday.

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to really like React. I'm not doing everything "right" at the moment, but getting things to show up and change with Firebase integration is pretty sweet.

### Day 2: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some stuff with authentication and styling. The code is ugly, but it's showing a single list for a specific user!

**Thoughts:** Again, my code is a mess, but I'm really enjoying React. In the next few days I'll do some refactoring and get it into a more presentable form.
